          green parts of the campus create a world of happiness, serenity and
          calm, the building provides a functional, safe and secure learning
          environment. Fully equipped smart classrooms, well-stocked library,
          Multipurpose hall, Basketball court, Skating Rink, music rooms,
          Open-air lunch space, Gazebo, and Bus services are what our
          infrastructure comprises of. <br />

          To enhance the aesthetics of the school campus, the entire school has
          artwork/murals displayed on walls or in corners with educational
          aspects attached to them. The surroundings are an epitome of cohesive
          learning with happiness and fun being the mantra throughout.

          Sports are as important for the all-round development of a child as

          success and failure equally. <br /> <br />
          The TAS campus has multiple sports facilities for both indoor and
          outdoor sports such as cricket, football, volleyball, basketball,

          Laboratories are rooms that feed the curiosity of our minds. They are

          experiments, and activities aiming to strengthen the concepts in an
          interactive way. Providing a hands-on experience, our laboratories
          pave the way to budding scientists and their experimentations.

          TAS prepares its students for the ICSE curriculum (Indian Certificate
          of Secondary Education) right from Grade I. Lessons are taught and
          concepts are imparted to the students with the aid of smart classes,
          role plays, experiments, and demonstrations. Students are encouraged
          to question and express themselves creatively.
          <br /> <br />
          The different types of co-curricular activities in the school help to
          broaden the horizons of learning. Inculcating a habit of reading is
          greatly emphasized and so is discipline. Speech and drama is an
          integral part of the curriculum and our annual concert is a
          testimonial for the same. Music and Sports are given equal importance
          for the all-round growth of our students. The curricular activities
          are complemented with Art and Craft, General Knowledge and Life
          Skills. Every child is unique and we ensure that every student is
          given individual attention. The curriculum at TAS is adapted to help
          every child realise his/her potential and emerge a winner.quipped labs

          Public speaking techniques are a life skill and students with a good
          hold over the same tend to be more confident, aware, better at
          decision-making and open-minded. Numerous intra-school and
          inter-school competitions such as extempore, debates, elocution,
          theatre and many more are conducted regularly to provide the children
          with a platform to showcase their talents. The school focuses on
          developing the public speaking skills as these play a major role in
          shaping the personality of the children from an early age. Not only do
          we aim to build their confidence but also assist them in overcoming
          fear and performance anxiety.
